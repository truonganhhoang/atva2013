============================

CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The purpose of ATVA is to promote research on theoretical and
practical aspects of automated analysis, verification and synthesis by

international research communities and industry in the field. The
previous events were held in Taiwan - 2003-5, Beijing - 2006, Tokyo -
2007, Seoul - 2008, Macao - 2009, Singapore - 2010, Taiwan - 2011, and

to:

- Formalisms for modeling hardware, software and embedded systems
- Specification and verification of finite-state, infinite-state and
  parameterized system
- Program analysis and software verification
- Analysis and verification of hardware circuits, systems-on-chip and
  embedded systems
- Analysis of real-time, hybrid, priced/weighted and probabilistic
  systems Deductive, algorithmic, compositional, and
  abstraction/refinement techniques for analysis and verification
- Analytical techniques for safety, security, and dependability
- Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology
- Analysis and verification of parallel and concurrent
  hardware/software systems
- Verification in industrial practice Applications and case studies


ATVA 2013  invites  submissions  for  workshop  proposals on
