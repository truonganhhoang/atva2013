CALL FOR PAPERS
ATVA 2013
11th International Symposium on Automated Technology for 
Verification and Analysis

October 15 - 18, 2013, Hanoi, Vietnam
http://uet.vnu.edu.vn/atva2013/
====================

The ATVA series of symposia is intended to promote research in
theoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, verification
and synthesis in Asia by providing a forum for interaction between the
regional and international research communities and industry in the
field. The previous editions of the symposium were held in Taiwan,
Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, Macao, Singapore, Taipei and
Thiruvananthapuram. Organised by the University of Engineering and
Technology – VNU Hanoi, ATVA 2013 will be held in the campus of
Vietnam National University, Hanoi from October 15th to October 18th,
2013.  

SCOPE 

ATVA 2013 solicits high quality submissions in areas
related to the theory and practice of automated analysis and
verification of hardware and software systems. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to: 

- Formalisms for modeling hardware, software and embedded systems 
- Specification and verification of finite-state, infinite-state and
  parameterized system 
- Program analysis and software verification 
- Analysis and verification of hardware circuits, systems-on-chip and
  embedded systems 
- Analysis of real-time, hybrid, priced/weighted and probabilistic
  systems 
- Deductive, algorithmic, compositional and abstraction/refinement
techniques for analysis and verification 
- Analytical techniques for safety, security, and dependability 
- Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology 
- Analysis and verification of parallel and concurrent
  hardware/software systems  
- Verification in industrial practice 
- Applications and case studies

Theory papers should preferably be motivated by practical problems,
and applications should be based on sound theory and should solve
problems of practical interest.

SUBMISSION 

Submissions are invited in two categories: regular research papers and
tool papers. Submitted papers must present original and unpublished
work, and must not be concurrently submitted to any other conference
or journal.

Regular paper submissions are restricted to 15 pages in Springer's
LNCS format, and tool paper submissions are restricted to 4 pages in
the same format. Proofs and details omitted due to space constraints
may be put in an appendix. Any such additional material will be read
by reviewers/program committee members at their discretion. Authors
are therefore urged to include details necessary for evaluation of the
technical merit of their work within the prescribed page limits.

Tool papers must include information about a URL from where the tool
can be downloaded or accessed on-line for evaluation. The URL must
also contain a set of examples, and a user's manual that describes
usage of the tool through examples. In case the tool needs to be
downloaded and installed, the URL must also contain a document clearly
giving instructions for installation of the tool on
Linux/Windows/MacOS.

Authors must upload PDF files of their papers through EasyChair at:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2013 

Accepted papers in both categories will be published by Springer as a
LNCS volume. At least one author of each accepted paper must also
register for the conference and present the paper.
